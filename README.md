## Important Notes

Note 1. I used Bootstrap, that was transpiled in dist/css file joining with my SCSS file where I'm Theming bootstrap, but due the live demo need the transpiled files (style.css) I must to avoid  .gitignoring the transpiled file (that has a lot of linters error because boostrat code). And just lintering about my Style.SCSS.
